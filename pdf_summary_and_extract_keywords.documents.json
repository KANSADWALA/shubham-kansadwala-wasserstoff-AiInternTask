The main submission on behalf of  the appellant was \ndirected towards establishing that the  entire  proceed: \nings  before the Additional District Magistrate and the \ntrying Magistrate were  without jurisdiction  as  cogniz \nance  of  the  offence  had been taken on September 16, \n1952, in contravention of the provisions  of  s.  23(3)  of \nthe  ]foreign  Exchange Regulation Act, there being on \nthat date no complaint in writing made  by  an  officer \nauthorised  in  that  behalf by the Central Government \nor the Reserve Bank of India by a  general or a  special \norder. It  is  clear,  therefore, \nthat upto September 16,  1952,  the  Additional  District \nMagistrate had not taken cognizance of any  offence. In  the present  case,  as  the \nrequisite authority had been  granted  by  the  Reserve \nBank  on  January  27,  1953,  to  file  a  complaint, the \ncomplaint filed  on February 2,  was one which complied \nwith the provisions of s.  23  of  the  ]foreign  Exchange \nRegulation Act and the Additional District Magistrate \ncould take cognizance of the  offence  which, indeed, he \ndid on that date.",
